# Transplutonic Resonator
Name Unrelated

## Goals
  * Charge batteries from DC and Solar sources
  * Be configurable so one board can be used in multiple projects
  * Support multiple chemistries

## Why
  * Couldn't find good charge controllers that accept arbitrary voltage within a range
  * LiFePO4 batteries aren't well supported by existing boards
  * I just need a simple power board, I don't know why this ended up being so hard
